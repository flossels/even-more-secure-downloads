# Extending `EXT:secure_downloads`

These repository contains some code examples that show you how you can easily extend 
[secure_downloads](https://github.com/Leuchtfeuer/typo3-secure-downloads/) (version 5.0 or higher) with your own tokens and / or 
security checks.

## Create Your Own Token

In this example another JWT Library is used to generate tokens. The token is signed with an RSA key pair which makes the token 
even more secure.

### Register the Token

The token is registered in the 
[ext_localconf.php](https://github.com/flossels/even-more-secure-downloads/blob/master/ext_localconf.php#L7) file:

```
\Leuchtfeuer\SecureDownloads\Registry\TokenRegistry::register(
    'tx_evenmoresecuredownloads_rsa',
    \Flossels\EvenMoreSecureDownloads\Domain\Transfer\Token\RsaToken::class,
    50,
    false
);
```

## Add Your Own Security Check

This sample check prevents the repeated use of generated tokens. It checks whether the token has already been used previously. If 
this is the case, the access to the deposited file will be denied.

### Register the Check

The security check will also be registered in the 
[ext_localconf.php](https://github.com/flossels/even-more-secure-downloads/blob/master/ext_localconf.php#L15) file by calling the 
public method `registerCheck` of the `Leuchtfeuer\SecureDownloads\Registry\CheckRegistry` class:

```
\Leuchtfeuer\SecureDownloads\Registry\CheckRegistry::register(
    'tx_evenmoresecuredownloads_once',
    \Flossels\EvenMoreSecureDownloads\Security\OneTimeCheck::class,
    50,
    true
);
```
